This repo contains the backend code for the web application.

*Important - READ BEFORE RUNNING THE APP*
1) Open "DB-myapp" file for the complete database of 'eKMIT'

2) server > routes > sms.js

Uncomment lines 37-46 to send SMS to mobile. Use it wisely because the texts are limited for this account. 
You can still view the OTP without uncommenting by checking the console.
Modify mobile in "user" table of DB to check SMS functionality (Give a number of your choice).


3) Modify email in "user" table of DB to check mail functionality. 
Fake email ids will cause delay.
